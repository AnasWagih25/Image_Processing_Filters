# Image Processing GUI

This project provides a simple MATLAB-based Image Processing GUI that allows users to apply various filters to images. Users can import an image, convert it to grayscale, apply Gaussian blur, perform edge detection, and save the processed image. The application is designed for ease of use with interactive buttons.

## Features

- **Import Image**: Load an image from your system.
- **Apply Grayscale**: Convert the image to grayscale.
- **Apply Gaussian Blur**: Apply a Gaussian blur to the image.
- **Edge Detection**: Perform edge detection on the image using the Canny edge detection method.
- **Save Processed Image**: Save the processed image to your system.

## Requirements

- MATLAB (version R2014b or higher)
- Image Processing Toolbox (for `imfilter`, `fspecial`, `edge`, etc.)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-processing-gui.git
Open MATLAB and navigate to the cloned repository directory.

Run the GUI by typing the following command in the MATLAB Command Window:
